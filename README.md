Analytics for Developers
================

Welcome to thoughtbot's Analytics for Developers workshop!

This repository is where you'll do your work for the workshop and contains the
slides, sample code, and answer keys.

Fork this private repo into your own Github Account.  If you don't know how to
do this, there are [instructions on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)

By working in your own fork of this repository we'll be able to see the code
you're writing, answer questions, and even comment on it.

Other students in the workshop will also be able to see the code you're writing
if they browse to your fork.

If you have any questions at all, you can ask them in the [Discussion Forum](http://forum.thoughtbot.com/category/analytics) or weekly office hours.
However, don't wait until the office hours if you get stuck or have questions,
we're here to help you!

Have fun!
